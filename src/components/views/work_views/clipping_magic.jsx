                  <p>It’s faster and more intuitive to use than Photoshop which makes it a popular choice for many e-commerce businesses. Recently it has encountered more competition from other online providers and needed a redesign that would help reflect and keep its dominate position in the market. This is the website portion of the redesign. </p>  
                  <p>My role was as designer and UI developer. I designed the changes, then implemented them. Check out the live site design <a href="https://clippingmagic.com" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

                    <p>We were able to gather quite a lot of insights on our users, both through customer interviews and though researching the greater e-commerce online community. The e-commerce community has quite a prolific online presence and I was able to find a lot of detailed content where they talked about their experience in general and, if they used it, their experience with Clipping Magic. Here’s a summary of what we found. </p>

                  <p>Clipping Magic gets the majority of new customers from being a top search result. As a part of the design, I wanted to focus on how the user experience through our primary customer funnel could be improved. This would help potential customers deciding whether or not to choose our tool and hopefully improve our bottom line. </p>

                  <p>The redesign focused on the landing page and the overall design of the site excluding the app itself. I therefore focused on how I could directly affect steps 1–3 and 5, prepare users for the later steps. </p>

                <p>Since there are a multitude of tools to choose from from a Google search, I wanted to make sure users understood how our tool worked so they would quickly see how easy and well it work compared to the others and not get turned away from unnecessary frustration.  </p>

                      <p>There were several design restraints that I had to take into consideration when laying out the site. The biggest constraint of the site was that everything had to be able to be internationalized. Clipping Magic is translated into 8 other languages than English. Each layout had to work with other European languages and Chinese, Korean and Japanese. Our framework had limited ability to allow for alternate styling for specific languages, so one layout had to work all the languages. </p>
